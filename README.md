# Programs
Hi there!
These programs are the ones I've coded in the past.
The quality may not be nice, and they *may* be some bugs in there... ðŸ˜Š
Some of them are 100% made by **me**, some others are coded by **AI**, and some are copies of famous programmers' projects.
Hope you'll have fun!

NOTE:
In `FunnyStoryApp`, there is some setup files for a .exe file. Check out `Funny Story.exe`! That's a app I've coded to make up jokes. 
`funny_story_gui.py` is the .py version of the `Funny Story.exe` located in `Programs/FunnyStoryApp`.

Setup Files are located in `Programs/Setup/`.
